# 1.1 Think About Time

The time management and productivity ideas that really got my attention were the promodoro technique and creating tiny habits. Time boxing essentially focuses on setting a timeframe on how long you will work on a particular project. I think one of the ways it can be used during Phase 0 is during pair programming. The way I currently manage my time is that I really don't. I currently just work on a project until tired or unable to continue, then come back to it at a later time. This is really not very practical or efficient since I don't have a schedule or organize my time effectively. My overall plan for Phase 0 is to create a schedule on when I'll be working on my projects and what not, and to really make use of the promodoro and creating tiny habits techniques which I think can be very beneficial during this time.

## 1.2 The Command Line

The shell is a program that interprets commands from the user so that the operating system can understand and perform those commands and Bash is the standard shell for the common user. Definitely the most challenging part about going through this material was all the new information that I needed to take in and memorizing it. I was able to perform all of the commands and in my opinion, the ls and grep commands are the most important commands to know. I'm still having trouble remembering all of the commands, so lets give this a try.

pwd- print working directory

ls- list directory

mv- move a file

cd- change directory

mkdir- make directory

less- page through a file

rmdir- remove directory

rm- remove a file

help- information about commands
