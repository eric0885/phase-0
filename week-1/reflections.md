# 1.1 Think About Time

The time management and productivity ideas that really got my attention were the promodoro technique and creating tiny habits. Time boxing essentially focuses on setting a timeframe on how long you will work on a particular project. I think one of the ways it can be used during Phase 0 is during pair programming. The way I currently manage my time is that I really don't. I currently just work on a project until tired or unable to continue, then come back to it at a later time. This is really not very practical or efficient since I don't have a schedule or organize my time effectively. My overall plan for Phase 0 is to create a schedule on when I'll be working on my projects and what not, and to really make use of the promodoro and creating tiny habits techniques which I think can be very beneficial during this time.


## 1.2 The Command Line

The shell is a program that interprets commands from the user so that the operating system can understand and perform those commands and Bash is the standard shell for the common user. Definitely the most challenging part about going through this material was all the new information that I needed to take in and memorizing it. I was able to perform all of the commands and in my opinion, the ls and grep commands are the most important commands to know. I'm still having trouble remembering all of the commands, so lets give this a try.

pwd- print working directory

ls- list directory

mv- move a file

cd- change directory

mkdir- make directory

less- page through a file

rmdir- remove directory

rm- remove a file

help- information about commands


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning

It's really simple and straight forward to create, fork and clone a repo. To create, you simply go to your GitHub account and on the top right of your page should be a "+" sign. simply click and select "New Repository". 

To fork a repository, you simply go to an existing repo and on the top right of the page should be a fork tab. Simply proceed to clicking it and select your account where you wish to fork it to.

Now to clone a repo you simply go to the repo you want cloned and find where the https clone url is on the page (which is on the right side of the page) and copy the link. You then proceed to go to your terminal and type in; git clone (paste link here). 

The main reason for forking a repo as opposed to creating a new one is that, when you fork it, you can make changes and elaborate on an existing file without affecting the original. When creating a repo, you are simply starting from scratch.
